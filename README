ActiveRecordMerge
=================

Adds a merge! method to ActiveRecord instances. This method automatically merges attributes and associations from one record to another, destroying the other record when it's done.

Note: I don't know if I ever actually used this, but it's a good example of database testing in plugins so I like to keep it around.
